The **Personal Strategy Engine** is an open-source application designed to augment your social and strategic intelligence. It's a tool for mapping your personal and professional networks, understanding the dynamics within them, and making more informed decisions to achieve your goals.  

This project is being built entirely in the open, and we welcome contributors of all kinds to help shape its future.

## üß† Core Philosophy
This project is founded on a few key principles:

- **Privacy is Paramount**: Your relationships and personal notes are your most sensitive data. We are building this application on a zero-knowledge architecture. All your data is encrypted and decrypted on your device. We can never access your unencrypted data.  
- **User in Control**: You own your data. You can export or delete it at any time. The tool is designed to augment your intelligence, not replace it.  
- **Transparency Through Open Source**: By building in public, we invite scrutiny and collaboration. Anyone can review the code to verify our security and privacy claims.  
- **Strategic Augmentation, Not Just Memory**: We aim to provide tools that help you understand the structure and dynamics of your network, empowering you to think more strategically.

## üöÄ Current Status: Phase 1 MVP - *The Insightful Relationship Map*
The project is currently in the first phase of development, focused on building a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** that delivers immediate and unique value.  

The goal is to create a secure foundation and a powerful visualization tool that is useful on its own and sets the stage for future capabilities.

---

## üó∫Ô∏è The Vision & Roadmap

**Phase 1: The Insightful Relationship Map (Current Focus)**  
- A secure, zero-knowledge vault for your relationship data.  
- Powerful network visualization and Social Network Analysis (SNA).  

**Phase 2: The Probabilistic Co-Pilot**  
- Introduce permission-based data enrichment.  
- Implement NLP-based personality trait extraction from notes and logs.  
- Develop on-device, privacy-preserving ML models to provide behavioral insights.  

**Phase 3: The Full Strategy Engine**  
- AI-driven Decision Support System for scenario simulation and risk analysis.  
- Strategic "Playbooks" for interpersonal challenges (e.g., negotiation, conflict resolution).  

---

## ‚ú® Key Features (MVP)

- **Zero-Knowledge Security**: End-to-end encryption with keys only you hold.  
- **Manual Relationship Logging**: Add contacts, log interactions, and record notes.  
- **Interactive Network Visualization**: See your network as a dynamic graph.  
- **Client-Side Social Network Analysis (SNA)**: Metrics include:  
  - *Centrality*: Identify the most influential people.  
  - *Tie Strength*: See which relationships are strongest.  
  - *Structural Holes*: Discover opportunities to bridge disconnected parts of your network.

## üíª Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Vite  
- **State Management**: Zustand (with React Context API fallback)  
- **Graph Visualization & Analysis**: Cytoscape.js  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Cryptography**: Web Crypto API + @noble/hashes  
- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS
