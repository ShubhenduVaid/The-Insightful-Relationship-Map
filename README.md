The **Personal Strategy Engine** is an open-source application designed to augment your social and strategic intelligence. It's a tool for mapping your personal and professional networks, understanding the dynamics within them, and making more informed decisions to achieve your goals.  

This project is being built entirely in the open, and we welcome contributors of all kinds to help shape its future.

## üß† Core Philosophy
This project is founded on a few key principles:

- **Privacy is Paramount**: Your relationships and personal notes are your most sensitive data. We are building this application on a zero-knowledge architecture. All your data is encrypted and decrypted on your device. We can never access your unencrypted data.  
- **User in Control**: You own your data. You can export or delete it at any time. The tool is designed to augment your intelligence, not replace it.  
- **Transparency Through Open Source**: By building in public, we invite scrutiny and collaboration. Anyone can review the code to verify our security and privacy claims.  
- **Strategic Augmentation, Not Just Memory**: We aim to provide tools that help you understand the structure and dynamics of your network, empowering you to think more strategically.

## üöÄ Current Status: Phase 1 MVP - **Complete**
The Phase 1 MVP is now **fully implemented and tested** with all core features working:

**‚úÖ Authentication System Complete**: Zero-knowledge user registration and login with client-side cryptography is fully implemented and tested.

**‚úÖ Data Management Complete**: Full contact management system with CRUD operations, search, filtering, and encrypted storage.

**‚úÖ Network Visualization Complete**: Interactive relationship mapping with Cytoscape.js, Social Network Analysis metrics, and dynamic layouts.

**‚úÖ Auto-Sync Complete**: Seamless automatic data synchronization with session-based password storage for optimal user experience.

**‚úÖ Comprehensive Testing**: 151 tests passing across client and server with full unit and integration test coverage.

The MVP delivers immediate value as a secure, privacy-first relationship management and network analysis tool.

## üó∫Ô∏è The Vision & Roadmap

**Phase 1: The Insightful Relationship Map (‚úÖ Complete)**  
- A secure, zero-knowledge vault for your relationship data.  
- Powerful network visualization and Social Network Analysis (SNA).  
- Automatic data synchronization with session-based security.

**Phase 2: The Probabilistic Co-Pilot (Next)**  
- Introduce permission-based data enrichment.  
- Implement NLP-based personality trait extraction from notes and logs.  
- Develop on-device, privacy-preserving ML models to provide behavioral insights.  

**Phase 3: The Full Strategy Engine (Future)**  
- AI-driven Decision Support System for scenario simulation and risk analysis.  
- Strategic "Playbooks" for interpersonal challenges (e.g., negotiation, conflict resolution).
