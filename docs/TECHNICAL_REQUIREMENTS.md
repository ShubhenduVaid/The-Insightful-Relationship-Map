*Document Status: ✅ COMPLETE - All requirements implemented and tested*  
*Last Updated: September 1, 2025*
4. The client sends the email and the computed authentication hash to the `/login` endpoint for verification against the stored hash.

**Encryption Key Generation:**
- Upon successful login, the client will re-derive a separate 32-byte (256-bit) encryption key from the master password and salt using the same PBKDF2-SHA256 function.
- This encryption key is held only in the client's application memory for the duration of the session and is never transmitted to the server.

### 3.2. Data Encryption and Decryption

**Encryption Algorithm**: All user data will be encrypted using AES-256 in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). AES-GCM is chosen as it provides both confidentiality and authenticity (tamper-detection).

**Encryption Process:**
1. All user data (contacts, interactions, relationships) will be structured as a single JSON object.
2. This object will be stringified using `JSON.stringify()`.
3. A new, cryptographically secure 12-byte Initialization Vector (IV) will be generated for each encryption operation.
4. The JSON string will be encrypted using AES-256-GCM with the in-memory encryption key and the newly generated IV.
5. The resulting ciphertext, IV, and GCM authentication tag will be combined into a single data blob for storage.

**Decryption Process:**
1. The encrypted data blob is fetched from the server.
2. The IV and authentication tag are extracted from the blob.
3. The ciphertext is decrypted using the in-memory encryption key, IV, and tag.
4. The resulting plaintext is parsed using `JSON.parse()` to reconstruct the user's data object.

### 3.3. Data Storage (Server-Side)

**Database Schema**: A single collection/table named `users` will be used.

**Document Structure**: Each document will contain:
- `_id`: Unique identifier (e.g., MongoDB ObjectID).
- `email`: User's email address (indexed for lookup).
- `salt`: The unique salt for the user's password hashing and key derivation (hex-encoded string).
- `authHash`: The PBKDF2-derived authentication hash (hex-encoded string).
- `dataBlob`: The encrypted user data vault (Base64-encoded string).

### 3.4. Data Transmission

All communication between the client and the backend API must be secured using HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or higher) to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 4. Backend API Specification

The backend will be a stateless RESTful API. Authentication for protected endpoints will be handled via JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

### API Endpoints

**POST /api/register**
- Body: `{ "email": "...", "salt": "...", "authHash": "..." }`
- Action: Creates a new user document in the database. Fails if the email already exists.
- Response: 201 Created with a JWT.

**POST /api/login**
- Body: `{ "email": "...", "authHash": "..." }`
- Action: Verifies the authHash against the stored hash for the given email.
- Response: 200 OK with a JWT and the user's dataBlob. 401 Unauthorized on failure.

**PUT /api/sync**
- Authorization: Bearer Token (JWT).
- Body: `{ "dataBlob": "..." }`
- Action: Overwrites the dataBlob for the authenticated user.
- Response: 200 OK on success.

## 5. Frontend Specification

### 5.1. Framework and Libraries

- **Core Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript for component-based architecture and type safety.
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **State Management**: Zustand for efficient state management with localStorage persistence.
- **Routing**: React Router v6 for client-side navigation and protected routes.

- **UI Components**: Radix UI + Tailwind CSS for accessible, professional components.
- **Testing**: Vitest for unit testing (better Vite integration), React Testing Library for component testing, and Playwright for E2E testing.
- **Package Manager**: pnpm for efficient dependency management in monorepo structure.

### 5.2. Authentication Implementation

**Zero-Knowledge Architecture**:

### 5.2. Data Model (Client-Side, Unencrypted)

The application state will manage a single, unencrypted JSON object representing the user's vault.

```json
{
  "contacts": [
    { "id": "uuid-1", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "notes": "..." }
  ],
  "interactions": [
    { "id": "uuid-2", "contactIds": ["uuid-1"], "timestamp": "2025-08-31T10:00:00Z", "summary": "..." }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    { "source": "uuid-1", "target": "uuid-3", "label": "colleague of" }
  ]
}
```

### 5.3. Social Network Analysis (SNA) Module

This module will be implemented client-side.

**Data Transformation**: A utility function will transform the contacts and relationships arrays from the data model into the elements format required by Cytoscape.js (an array of node and edge objects).

**Metric Calculation:**
- **Tie Strength**: A function will iterate through the interactions log. The strength of a tie (edge) between two contacts (nodes) will be calculated based on the frequency of their shared interactions within a given time window. This numerical value will be stored as a weight attribute on the edge data.
- **Centrality**: The cytoscape.js library's built-in `cy.elements().betweennessCentrality()` algorithm will be used to calculate the betweenness centrality for each node. This value will be stored as a centrality attribute on the node data.

**Visualization Mapping:**
- A Cytoscape.js stylesheet will be defined to map data attributes to visual properties.
- Node width and height will be mapped to the centrality score.
- Edge width will be mapped to the tieStrength score.

## 6. Performance and Scalability
